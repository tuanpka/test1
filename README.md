<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ElQc7ly.png)  

Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer. Early diagnosis of skin cancer is crucial for successful treatment.

This project aims to classify skin lesions using images from the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset. The HAM10000 dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which are labelled as one of the following conditions:

* Melanoma
* Melanocytic nevus
* Basal cell carcinoma
* Actinic keratosis
* Benign keratosis
* Dermatofibroma
* Vascular lesion

A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is built using Python and standard libraries to classify skin lesions into one of the above 7 conditions. The model is trained on the HAM10000 dataset.

The goal is to explore deep learning techniques to build an automated system capable of classifying skin cancer from images. Such a system can help dermatologists speed up the diagnostic process and improve early detection of malignant lesions.

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied in the medical field to build decision support systems and improve healthcare outcomes. Our model and code is open-sourced on Github to encourage collaboration between data scientists and healthcare professionals.
